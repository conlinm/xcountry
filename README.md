# Cross Country Recruit Manager

This is a web application that allows you to manage your cross country recruitment. Note that this is a submodule from my personal repo at https://github.com/conlinm/xcountry.git. This allowed us to keep the web app work separated for development purposes, and dev server running options, as well as facilitate pushing to git on google cloud. This is a complete copy of the web app code. If you need to git clone this repo, you will need to do so recursively in order for the submodule to be cloned.
For this repo: ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/cs411-su22/su22-cs411-team009-QueryCanaries.git```
